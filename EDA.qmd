# Introduction
The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a health-related telephone survey that is collected annually by the CDC. Each year, the survey collects responses from over 400,000 Americans on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of preventative services. It has been conducted every year since 1984. For this project, a csv of the dataset available on Kaggle for the year 2015 was used. The original dataset contains responses from 441,455 individuals and has 330 features. These features are either questions directly asked of participants, or calculated variables based on individual participant responses. 

Our dataset of interest is named:`diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv` and is a clean dataset of 253,680 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2015. The target variable Diabetes_binary has 2 classes. 0 is for no diabetes, and 1 is for prediabetes or diabetes. This dataset has 21 feature variables and is not balanced.

#### Import Data and code factor levels
A short label is provided for concise labeling of plots and tables, and a long variable to provide additional information about the variable

## EDA
Purpose: The purpose of this EDA is to create meaningful summary statistics and plots with `Diabetes_binary` as the primary response variable. Various summaries describing data structures, summaries, accounting of missing values, distributions of data, contingency tables, plots, correlations, etc will be created so that we can form the basis for the elucidation and analysis of meaningful patterns in the dataset capable of predicting the onset of diabetes via the `Diabetes_binary` variable

### Data Inspection
#### Purpose: Observe the structure of imported data, basic summaries, and summary of missing values
#### Observations: 
##### 1. Successful import and variable factoring
##### 2. No missing values
##### 3. Expected factor levels

### Histograms of numeric variables
##### Visualizing the distribution of numeric variables in the data
```{r}
ggplot(diabeetus, aes(x = BMI)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(diabeetus, aes(x = MentHlth )) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) + labs(x = "Days of Poor Mental Health in Last Month",y = "Number of People")
ggplot(diabeetus, aes(x = PhysHlth )) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) + labs(x = "Days of Poor Physical Health in Last Month",y = "Number of People")
```
### Box Plots of numeric variables
```{r}
# Select numerical variables to plot
num_vars <- c("BMI", "MentHlth", "PhysHlth")

# Should I log transform BMI? 
# Data are skewed: Y, but not by much, and not a large range of values spanning
# more than one order of magnitude

# Should I log transform PhysHlth / MentlHlth? 
# Data are skewed: Y, but a discrete range (0-30) so no
# more than one order of magnitude



# Create long format data for plotting

  pivot_longer(cols = -Diabetes_binary, 
               names_to = "variable",

### Stacked Proportion Plots
#### Purpose: Investigae categories that have higher proportions of diabetes between factor levels as a first pass selection for model parameters
### Observations:
#### Largest differences between factor levels for subjects with a higher percentage of diabetes incidence are from the following variables
##### - HighBP
##### - HighChol
##### - DiffWalk
##### - HeartDiseaseorAttack
##### - Smoker
##### - General Health


```{r}

# Function to create proportion plots for multiple variables

    ggplot(aes(x = Diabetes_binary, fill = !!sym(var_name))) +

### Correlation Plot
##### Purpose: Determine correlations between the predictor variable and numeric factors
##### Outcome: High correlations for mental and physical health, but choosing General Health as an overall predictor because it has distinct levels
```{r}

num_vars <- c("BMI", "MentHlth", "PhysHlth")

numeric_correlations <- diabeetus |>
  select(Diabetes_binary, all_of(num_vars)) |>
  mutate(Diabetes_binary = as.numeric(Diabetes_binary) - 1) |>
  cor()

ggplot(data = as.data.frame(numeric_correlations) %>%
         rownames_to_column("var1") %>%
         pivot_longer(-var1, names_to = "var2", values_to = "correlation")) +
  geom_tile(aes(x = var1, y = var2, fill = correlation)) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue", mid = "white", high = "red") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Correlation Heatmap of Numeric Variables")


```


### Model Selection
#### Based on differences of proportional incidence of diabetes via visual inspection, and historical context for health factors negatively associated with poor health in general, the choice for parameters in rank-order are:
1. HighBP
2. HighChol
3. DiffWalk
4. HeartDiseaseorAttack
5. Smoker
6. GenHlth
